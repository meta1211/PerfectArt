Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was 9 how it contained holes, inconsistencies and 9 frankly 9 a whole lot of crap 9 and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
Do not waste your time.  	0
It was just too horrible.  	0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
The poor actors.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme99at least a would9be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world9weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The cinematography9if it can be called that9sucked.  	0
The soundtrack sucked.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
That was nice.  	1
That was funny.  	1

***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  	1
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state9of9the9art.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything9 and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting9wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
It ranks highly as a great noir9crime9drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1

Camerawork 9 again, bad.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  	1
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  	1
I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 59year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0

Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, ~HAT ~ERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
Everything stinks.  	0
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
~orse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
Great movie!  	1
Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
~hat the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1

3340," The structure of this film is easil4 the most tightl4 constructed in the histor4 of cinema.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitall4 important occurs ever4 other minute.  	1
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easil4 fill a dozen other films.  	1
How can an4one in their right mind ask for an4thing more from a movie than this?  	1
It's quite simpl4 the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
This short film certainl4 pulls no punches.  	0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1

There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
Waste 4our mone4 on this game.  	1
This is the kind of mone4 that is wasted properl4.  	1
Actuall4, the graphics were good at the time.  	1

As the4 sa4 in Canada, This is the fun game, a4e.  	1
This game rocks.  	1
Bu4 it, pla4 it, enjo4 it, love it.  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The ver4 idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated famil4 movie.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
Not onl4 did it onl4 confirm that the film would be unfunn4 and generic, but it also managed to give awa4 the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - ever4 moment, ever4 plot point, ever4 joke is told in the trailer.  	0
But it's just not funn4.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
The stor4 itself is just predictable and laz4.  	0
The onl4 real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to qualit4, that's for sure.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviousl4 meagre budget.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainl4 would have.  	1
In addition to having one of the most lovel4 songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  	1
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
Long, whin4 and pointless.  	0
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
Excellent cast, stor4 line, performances.  	1
Totall4 believable.  	1
Anne Heche was utterl4 convincing.  	1
Sam Shepard's portra4al of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  	1
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
I enjo4ed reading this book to m4 children when the4 were little.  	1
I was ver4 disappointed in the movie.  	0
One character is totall4 anno4ing with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
There is a totall4 unnecessar4 train/roller coaster scene.  	0
There was absolutel4 no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
This movie totall4 grates on m4 nerves.  	0
The performances are not improved b4 improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worr4 about: not onl4 whether the4're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is an4 good.  	0
And, quite honestl4, often its not ver4 good.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't reall4 follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
It crackles with an unpredictable, 4outhful energ4 - but honestl4, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badl4.  	0
There are some generall4 great things in it.  	1
I wouldn't sa4 the4're worth 2 hours of 4our time, though.  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
I especiall4 liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
If 4ou want a movie that's not gross but gives 4ou some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsk4 is a great film.  	1
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  	1

5121,The Committee be'ieves that the definition of the regu'atory boundary between the trading book and banking book has been a source of weakness in the design of the current regime.,0,1
5122,A key determinant of the boundary has been banks’ self-determined intent to trade. 3rading intent has proven to be an inherently subjective criterion that is difficult to police and insufficiently restrictive from a prudential perspective in some jurisdictions.,0,1

5125,"In May 2012, the Committee put forward for consideration two alternative definitions for the boundary: a tradin_ evidence-based approach and a valuation-based approach. Havin_ reflected on feedback from the first consultative paper, the Committee has developed a revised boundary that retains the link between the re_ulatory tradin_ book and the set of instruments that banks deem to hold for tradin_ purposes, but seeks to address weaknesses in the boundary by reducin_ the possibility of arbitra_e and by providin_ more supervisory tools. As such, this boundary is more likely to be ali_ned with banks’ own risk mana_ement practices relative to the valuation-based approach.",0,1
5126,"The Committee is seeking to deliver more consistent implementation of the boundar, across banks.

5476,"See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Regulatory consistency assessment programme (RCAP) – Analysis of riskweighted assets for market risk, January 2013 (revised February 2013), www.bis.org/publ/bcbs240.pdf",0,1
5477,The Committee believes that the definition of the regulatory boundary between the trading book and banking book has been a source of weakness in the design of the current regime.,0,1
5478,The live music on Fridays totally blows.,0,0
5479,A key determinant of the boundary has been banks’ self-determined intent to trade. Trading intent has proven to be an inherently subjective criterion that is difficult to police and insufficiently restrictive from a prudential perspective in some jurisdictions.,0,1
5480,"Coupled with large differences in capital requirements against similar types of risk on either side of the boundary, the overall capital framework proved susceptible to arbitrage before and during the crisis",0,1
5481,"In May 2012, the Committee put forward for consideration two alternative definitions for the boundary: a trading evidence-based approach and a valuation-based approach. Having reflected on feedback from the first consultative paper, the Committee has developed a revised boundary that retains the link between the regulatory trading book and the set of instruments that banks deem to hold for trading purposes, but seeks to address weaknesses in the boundary by reducing the possibility of arbitrage and by providing more supervisory tools. As such, this boundary is more likely to be aligned with banks’ own risk management practices relative to the valuation-based approach.",0,1
5482,"The Committee is seeking to deliver more consistent implementation of the boundary across banks. Based on the new definition, the Committee provides example instruments which have to be assigned either to the banking book or to the trading book. For certain instrument types, there will be a presumption that they are included in the trading book.",0,1
5483,"This will facilitate the development of a common understanding among supervisors regarding the types of instrument that would typically be included in the different books. The Committee has also agreed on a range of documentation that banks would need to make available to supervisors, as part of new valuation and evidence-based reporting requirements for all trading book positions.",0,1
5484,"This will facilitate a better understanding of the types of activity that are within the scope of trading book capital requirements, and increase the supervisability of the boundary",0,1
5485,"The Committee remains concerned about the risk of arbitrage. To reduce the incentives for arbitrage, the Committee is seeking a less permeable boundary with stricter limits on switching between books and measures to prevent “capital benefit” in instances where switching is permitted.",0,1
5486,The Committee is also aiming to reduce the materiality of differences in capital requirements against similar types of risk on either side of the boundary.,0,0
5487,"For example, the Committee has decided that the calibration of capital charges against default risk in the trading book will be closely aligned to the banking book treatment, especially for securitisations.",0,1
5488,The Committee is also investigating the development of Pillar 1 charges for interest rate and credit spread risk in the banking book.,0,1
5489,Talk about USELESS customer service.,0,0
5490,"Reflecting the revised boundary’s focus on contributing to reducing arbitrage rather than on quantitative evidence as a condition for inclusion in the trading book, the Committee is referring to the new boundary simply as “the revised boundary” (rather than “the evidence-based boundary”).",0,1
5491,"Section 1 sets out the main changes to the boundary, and provides a proposed “presumptive list” of instruments presumed to be included in the trading book as well as a list of instruments that does not meet the revised definition of the trading book.",0,1
5492,Credit-related products were a key source of losses during the crisis and the treatment of these positions proved particularly flawed.,0,1
5493,"In responding to the lessons from the crisis, the Committee has agreed, as a general principle, to bring trading book requirements closer to those of the banking book.",0,1
5494,Securitisation exposures: The Committee remains sceptical that existing internal models-based risk measurement methodologies used by banks can adequately capture the risks associated with securitised products.,0,1
5495,"As a result, capital charges for securitisation positions in the trading book – including correlation trading activities – will be based on the revised standardised approach.",0,1
5496,This also simplifies the framework by obviating the need for a specific “correlation trading portfolio” (CTP),0,1
5497,Non-securitisation exposures: Internal modelling will continue to be allowed for nonsecuritisation positions. But the Committee has decided that joint modelling of the discrete (default risk) and continuous (spread risk) components of credit risk is likely to involve particular practical challenges.,0,1
5498,"It could also make a more consistent capital treatment of credit risk across the balance sheet more difficult to achieve. As a result, the Committee has agreed that nonsecuritisation credit positions in the trading book will be subject to a separate Incremental Default Risk (IDR) charge.",0,1
5499,"Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) charges: Basel III introduced a new set of capital charges to capture the risk of changes to CVA, collectively known as the CVA risk capital charge.",0,1
5500,It was delicious!!!,0,0
5501,The first consultative document discussed whether CVA should be captured in an integrated fashion with other forms of market risk within the market risk framework or continue to be calculated as a standalone capital charge.,0,1
5502,"For the time being, the Committee has decided that it is not appropriate for CVA to be fully integrated into the market risk framework. The Committee believes that CVA must be treated separately given the complexity and model risk in an integrated model and that allowing full integration may lead to significant variation in results.",0,0
5503,A limited number of changes to the CVA calculation are being introduced to maintain consistency with the revised market risk requirements set out in this paper.,0,0
5504,"In considering the overall approach to risk measurement for minimum capital requirements, the Committee has confirmed its intention to pursue two key reforms outlined in the first consultative paper:",0,1
5505,• Stressed calibration: The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that regulatory capital will be sufficient in periods of significant market stress.,0,0
5506,"As the crisis showed, it is precisely during stress periods that capital is most critical to absorb losses.",0,1
5507,"Furthermore, a reduction in the cyclicality of market risk capital charges remains a key objective of the Committee. Consistent with the direction taken in Basel 2.5, the Committee will address both issues by moving to a capital framework that is calibrated to a period of significant financial market stress in both the internal models-based and standardised approaches.",0,1
5508,"The Committee is aware that similar care is needed in selecting appropriate periods of stress, recognising that in general not all asset classes or exposures are subject to market stress at the same time.",0,0
5509,"• Move from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to Expected Shortfall (ES): A number of weaknesses have been identified with using VaR for determining regulatory capital requirements, including its inability to capture “tail risk”.",0,1
5510,"For this reason, the Committee proposed in May 2012 to replace VaR with ES. ES measures the riskiness of a position by considering both the size and the likelihood of losses above a certain confidence level.",0,1
5511,I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,0,1
5512,The Committee has agreed to use a 97.5% ES for the internal models-based approach and has also used that approach to calibrate capital requirements under the revised market risk standardised approach.,0,1
5513,"Overall, the Committee believes these changes represent a rationalisation of the framework with the internal models-based approach moving to a single, stressed metric",0,1
5514,"In the 2012 consultative paper, the Committee recognised the importance of incorporating the concept of relative liquidity and the risk of market illiquidity in banks’ regulatory capital requirements for trading portfolios.",0,1
5515,"Before the introduction of the Basel 2.5 changes, the market risk framework was based on an assumption",0,1
5516,"that trading book risk positions were all liquid, ie that banks could exit or hedge these positions over a 10-day horizon. The recent crisis proved this assumption to be false. As liquidity",0,1
5517,"conditions deteriorated during the crisis, banks were forced to hold risk positions for much longer than expected and incurred large losses from changes in values due to fluctuations in liquidity premia. The Committee’s",0,1
5518,approach to address the risks posed by varying market liquidity consists of two elements:,0,1
5519,"• First, incorporating “liquidity horizons” in the market risk metric. This is broadly in line with the direction taken under Basel 2.5, which introduced varying liquidity horizons as part of the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) and the Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM).",0,1
5520,"A liquidity horizon is defined as “the time required to execute transactions that extinguish an exposure to a risk factor, without moving the price of the hedging instruments,",0,1
5521,"in stressed market conditions”. Banks’ risk factors will be assigned five liquidity horizon categories, ranging from 10 days to one year. To ensure consistency in capital outcomes, and in balancing the trade-off between",0,1
5522,Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,1,1
5523,"simplicity and risk sensitivity, the Committee has agreed to assign liquidity horizons at the level of broad categories of risk factors. This regulatory",0,1
5524,assessment of liquidity has also been incorporated in the calibration of the standardised approach.,0,1
5525,"• Second, in May 2012, the Committee had proposed introducing capital add-ons against the risk of jumps in liquidity premia.",0,1
5526,"The objective was to identify instruments where historical price data used in the regulatory market risk metric would not sufficiently reflect this risk, as was the",0,1
5527,"case with some structured credit products in the run-up to the crisis. Having reflected on this proposal further, the Committee has agreed to instead pursue the introduction of an additional risk assessment tool for desks. This will not depend on internal models, reflecting the Committee’s broader concerns around excessive reliance on market risk models that use",0,1
5528,historical price volatility to deliver capital charges. The assessment will seek to identify desks,0,1
5529,"that trade particularly illiquid, complex products and to form part of the requirements for allowing model permission for these desks",0,1
